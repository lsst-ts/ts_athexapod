The CSC is implemented using the salobj library for integration with the middleware layer.

The architecture of the Hexapod control software is a TCP/IP connection with a particular messaging format.
You can find in the `PI-824 manual <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-21614>`__
where it describes this format.

.. _Build:

Build and Test
==============

A note before beginning to develop this package.
Install Docker as this is required.

This package has the following requirements:

* Docker
* ts_Dockerfiles - lsstts/develop-env:b76(stable) or lsstts/develop-env:develop(bleeding edge)

.. We should link to a description of the development container once there is a place for it.

Build the CSC as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -it -v {repos_location}:/home/saluser/develop lsstts/develop-env:b76
    make_idl_files.py ATHexapod
    cd develop/ts_athexapod
    setup -kr .
    scons



.. _Usage:

Usage
=====

Starting the CSC is done by using the following command.

.. prompt:: bash

    python bin/runATHexapodCSC.py

Stopping the CSC is done by SIG-INTing the process, usually by :kbd:`ctrl` + :kbd:`c`

Running the unit tests can be done from the top-level directory of the repository by invoking

.. prompt:: bash
    
    pytest


.. _Simulator:

Simulator
=========
There is a vendor provided simulator that can be started as a docker container.
Since this is proprietary, the image is private and so to get access, send a request on slack to couger01 with your username on DockerHub.
Then use docker to sign into your dockerhub credentials with the following command.

.. prompt:: bash

    docker login
    # give username and password

Then pulling and running the image will work.

.. this throws a warning but I'm not sure why.

.. prompt:: bash

    docker run --net host -it couger01/hexapod_simulator

Stopping the CSC is done by SIG-INTing the process, usually by :kbd:`ctrl` + :kbd:`c`

.. _Contributing:

Contributing
============

Code and documentation contributions utilize pull-requests on github.
Feature requests can be made by filing a Jira ticket with the `ts_athexapod` label.
In all cases, reaching out to the :ref:`contacts for this CSC <Contact_Personnel>` is recommended.

.. _Firmware:

Updating Firmware For ATHexapod
===============================

Instructions on updating the firmware can be found in `chapter 10 of the PI-824 manual <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-21614>`_.
As an aside, upgrading the firmware is difficult and can result in problems if not performed correctly.
It is strongly encouraged to only upgrade if the vendor is recommending this be performed.


.. _Documentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================


Pull the develop-env docker image (the example below uses version `b76`, but this should be changed to the current release), mounting the repository directory as a volume.
Then building the documentation is done by the following commands.

.. prompt:: bash

    docker run -it -v {repo_location}:/home/saluser/develop lsstts/develop-env:b76
    cd develop/ts_athexapod
    setup -kr . # or pip install .
    scons # this step is optional if using pip
    pip install -r doc/requirements.txt
    package-docs build
